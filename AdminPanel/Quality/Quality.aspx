            Quality : The No Compromised Matter - At All is our motto as we do care entirely of our valued customers. We just completed ISO: 9001-2000 audit by TUV GmbH and are certified by them as an ISO-9001:2000 company. Hence, our working is according to their norms and that speak about the level of quality we are maintaining at any level of our transaction. Every product is being tested several times by different professionals for quality.

However, final authority lies with the quality control inspectors who can approve the quality by selection or rejection of the forging for sale, depending upon the merits of the same. Only superior quality products are being offered to the customers as we are using superior quality of steels like CK-45, EN8D, EN9, 42CrMo4, 40Cr1, EN-15 etc. to produce our products. And that’s why we succeed to manufacture Tailor Forgings for the industries in need.
